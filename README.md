# Predictive Maintenance with Hyperparameter Tuning

This Google Colab notebook demonstrates the process of building and optimizing machine learning models for predictive maintenance. The focus is on fine-tuning model performance using hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps include handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing data imbalances.
- **Model Training**: Implements machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests) for predictive maintenance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - **Grid Search CV**: Exhaustive search over a parameter grid.
  - **Randomized Search CV**: Randomized search over hyperparameters for faster results.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and R-squared for model evaluation.

## File Contents
The notebook is structured into the following sections:
1. **Introduction**:
   - Overview of predictive maintenance and the significance of hyperparameter tuning.
2. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Loads the dataset, explores its structure, and visualizes key statistics.
   - Includes visualizations like histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handles missing values and scales numerical features.
   - Uses techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance.
4. **Model Training and Baseline Performance**:
   - Trains baseline models and evaluates their initial performance.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimizes model parameters using Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV.
   - Displays best hyperparameters and their corresponding evaluation metrics.
6. **Results and Visualization**:
   - Compares models' performance with detailed metrics and visualizations.
   - Plots feature importances and confusion matrices.

### Sample Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a glimpse of hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search CV:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=3, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Best Parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
```
